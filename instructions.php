    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>You are now entering the decision-making game, commonly referred to as the Public Goods Game, which will consist
        of
        one practice round and three parts. Every part will consist of three rounds in total and is a slightly different
        variation of the initial game. It is important that you read these instructions carefully as the decisions that
        you
        make in the experiment will affect which lottery you will be able to enter. Your total payoff for the experiment
        will be the results of one of the parts of the experiment chosen at random by the computer. In this experiment
        we
        use Experiment Currency Units (ECU’s)s, which will be later transformed into payments
        according to the following rate:</p>

    <p>10 ECU = 1£</p>

    <p>You have been grouped with three other participants and will remain playing with them for the entirety of the
        game.
        They have been given the same instructions that you are reading now and play by exactly the same rules. In the
        beginning of the experiment you and all the other participants will be endowed with 20 ECU, which you can choose
        to
        either contribute to the Social Good, or keep for yourself. For every ECU contributed to the Social Good every
        participant will receive 0.4 ECU’s. That makes the social return of every contributed ECU equal to 4*0.4 = 1.6.
        Every ECU that has not been contributed to the social good remains at your disposal.</p>

    <p>The number of the period appears in the top left corner of the screen. In the top right corner you can see how
        many
        more seconds remain for you to decide on the distribution of your points. Your decision must be made before the
        time
        displayed is 0 seconds, otherwise the programme will automatically contribute 0 to the Social Good. Your
        endowment
        in the beginning of each part is 20 ECUs. The amount of ECU in the next round depends on your decisions in the
        previous round. You have to decide how many points you want to contribute to the project by typing a number
        between
        0 and 20 in the input field. This field can be reached by clicking it with the mouse. As soon as you have
        decided
        how many points to contribute to the project, you have also decided how many ECUS you keep for yourself: this is
        (20
        - your contribution) ECUs. After entering your contribution you must press the O.K. button (either with the
        mouse,
        or by pressing the Enter - key). Once you have done this your decision can no longer be revised.</p>

    <p>After all members of your group have made their decision the following income screen will show you the total
        amount
        of points contributed by all four group members to the project (including your contribution). Also this screen
        shows
        you how many ECUs you have earned at the first stage. The income for the other players will be calculated in the
        same way as yours.</p>

    <p>Your income for the round will consist of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the ECUs which you have kept for yourself (“Income from ECU kept”);</li>
        <li>the “income from the project”. This income is calculated as follows: your income from the project = 0.4 x
            the
            total contribution of all 4 group members to the project.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>In total: payout = (20 - your contribution to the project) + 0.4*(total contributions to the project)</p>


    <h1>Comprehension Quiz</h1>
    <p>These questions are designed to check if you have understood the instructions. The programme will not allow you
        to
        continue to the start of the game unless each of the questions have been answered correctly.</p>
