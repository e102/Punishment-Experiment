    <h3>Welcome </h3>
    <p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in todayâ€™s experiment. You are now about to take part in a decision-making experiment which serves as a part of an independent research project, for which you will be paid by entering a lottery to win a prize (SPECIFY). There will be (SEVERAL) prizes you might be able to enter the lottery for, however, that would entirely depend on your decisions in this game. In order to receive the price, you will be required to fill in several questionnaires as well as play a decision-making game.<br>
        For the experiment you will be given a randomly generated user number, which ensures that neither the experimenter nor the other participants will be able to connect your answers to you. Please note that because your results are anonymised at all stages of the experiment, it will not be possible to withdraw your data after the experiment is complete. Any personal data will be stored in a secure environment in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.<br>
        Please note that you are free to drop out at any point during the experiment, at which point you will still be able to enter the basic draw for the cheapest prize, however, will not be able to enter the lottery for the bigger ones. Shall you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact the experimenter at any time during the experiment or after it using the contact details provided at the bottom of the page. In the unlikely event that the experimenter cannot answer your questions, please contact the supercviser of this project, Dr. Kyle Treiber (CONTACT DETAILS).
        Please refrain from communicating with the other participants (current or former) for the duration of the experiment and make all decisions independently, without discussing them with others.</p>
