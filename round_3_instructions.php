<h1>Game 3 Instructions</h1>
<p>In this game you will be playing the same game you have been playing before, however, the ability to punish or reward other participants will be removed. Instead, one participants at random will be allocated a role of a third party punisher (TPP). The other three participants play the game. None of the decisions in the game influence the payoff of the TPP, however, TPP may choose to reward and punish any other player in the game in the same way they could in the previous game.</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT: Player names have been changed. You are still playing with the same people, but their names have been reassigned.</h3>
