    <h1>Part 2 Instructions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to part two of the game! You will play with the same people you have played with before, however, they
        have different colours now. Your incomes have been cleared and every participant starts with 20 ECU regardless
        of their results in the previous game. The general rules of the game remain the same with one addition. In this
        game all participants gain a possibility to punish or reward any member of the group after every round.</p>

    <p>You punish by taking somebodyâ€™s ECU away and reward by giving somebody ECU. There is no limit, but there is a
        price for you. For every two ECU that you decide to reward or punish the other participants for, you lose one.
        So for every amount you wish you either reward or punish the other players you have to pay half of that sum. You
        cannot, however, go below zero.
    </p>

    <p>Player names have been changed. You are still playing with the same people, but their names have been
        reassigned.</p>
