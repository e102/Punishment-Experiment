        You will now play Part 1. The rules are the same as the practice game, but you will be playing with real people.<br>

        Remember:

    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">There are three rounds in this part</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You start with 20 ECUs in the first round and what you carry over to the next two rounds depends on your decisions</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You can contribute ECUs to the common good or keep them for yourself</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Common good doubles all the contributions and sheres them equally amongst all four players.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Your ECUs are the sum of the ECUs you decided to keep for yourself and your share of the ECU from the common good.</li>
