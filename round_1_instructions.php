<p>
    You will now play game 1. The rules are the same as the practice game, but you will be playing with real people.<br>
    Remember:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are three rounds in the game</li>
    <li>You start with 20 ECUs</li>
    <li>You can contribute ECUs to the common pool</li>
    <li>Your ECU's are the sum of your leftover ECUs and the total donated to the common pool times 0.4</li>
</ul>
